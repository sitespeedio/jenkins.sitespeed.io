  You can choose between outputting a JUnit XML, a <a href="http://testanything.org/">TAP</a> file or the result of your budget. 
  
  If you choose to output as JUnit XML, make sure to use the Jenkins built in <b>Post-build Actions</b> called <b>Publish JUnit test result</b>.
  
  If you use TAP, install the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin">Jenkins TAP plugin</a>.
  
  If you choose budget, the budget will be tested and if it fails, the script will return failed and the build will be marked as failing.
